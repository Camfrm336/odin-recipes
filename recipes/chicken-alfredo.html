        Chicken alfredo is a classic favoriteâ€”a creamy white sauce, long 
        strands of pasta mixed with tender pieces of lean protein.
        </p>    
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Chicken breast</li>
            <li>Pasta noodles</li>
            <li>Alfredo sauce</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><p><strong>Boil the noodles: </strong>Cook the Fettuccine 
                al dente, according to package instructions.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Cook the chicken: </strong>Season the 
                chicken, then pan-fry in oil and butter, 
                for 6 minutes a side, or until an internal 
                temperature reaches 165 degrees F. Transfer to a cutting board and 
                let rest for a few minutes, then cut into 1/2-inch thick slices. 
                Tent with foil, while you prepare the sauce.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Make the Alfredo sauce: </strong>Using the same pan you used to cook 
                the chicken, the cream, butter, and seasonings are 
                incorporated and simmered on medium-low heat until thickened, 
                then the Parmesan is added in until melted and smooth.</li></p>
            <li><p><strong>Assemble: </strong>Drain the pasta, reserving some of the 
                liquid to loosen the sauce <em>(only if necessary.)</em> 
                Toss immediately with the Alfredo sauce. Divide the pasta among 
                serving bowls and top with a few slices of cooked chicken. 
                Garnish with parsley, more Parmesan, and black pepper if desired.</li></p>
            
        </ol>
